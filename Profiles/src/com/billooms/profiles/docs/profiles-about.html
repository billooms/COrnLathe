    <h2>
      Cutter Profiles
    </h2>
    <p>
      Profiles define the shape of the cutter tip. 
    </p>
    <p>
      The following profiles are "built-in" to the software. 
      Additional profiles may be added by the user (see the help file on the Profile Editor). 
      Also, a user may program their own profiles and make them permanent additions to 
      their copy of the software (or distribute them as plug-ins to others).

    <ul>
      <li> 
        <img src="Ideal.png" width="105" height="35" align="middle">
        <b>IDEAL</b> -- A infinitely sharp and narrow cutter. 
        If the cutting is all done by a very sharp tip, then this is a good approximation. 
        Note: Using any other option will <b>significantly</b> slow down the rendering 
        of the cut surface! 
      </li>
      <li> 
        <img src="Point60.png" width="105" height="35" align="middle">
        <b>POINT60</b> -- The cutting tip is a 60 degree angle (as with a triangular 
        carbide insert). Use this only if your cut pattern depends on significant 
        cutting on the side of the cutter (rather than just the tip). 
      </li>
      <li> 
        <img src="Point90.png" width="105" height="35" align="middle">
        <b>POINT90</b> -- The cutting tip is a 90 degree angle. Use this only if 
        your cut pattern depends on significant 
        cutting on the side of the cutter (rather than just the tip). 
      </li>
      <li> 
        <img src="Point120.png" width="105" height="35" align="middle">
        <b>POINT120</b> -- The cutting tip is a 120 degree angle. Use this only if 
        your cut pattern depends on significant 
        cutting on the side of the cutter (rather than just the tip). 
      </li>
      <li> 
        <img src="Flat.png" width="105" height="35" align="middle">
        <b>FLAT</b> -- The cutting tip is flat on the end. 
        You would use this, for example, when doing a "basket" style pattern. 
      </li>
      <li> 
        <img src="Round.png" width="105" height="35" align="middle">
        <b>ROUND</b> -- The cutting tip is a convex half circle. 
        Use this only if your cut pattern depends on significant cutting on the side 
        of the cutter (rather than just the tip). 
      </li>
      <li> 
        <img src="Concave.png" width="105" height="35" align="middle">
        <b>CONCAVE</b> -- The cutting tip is a concave half circle. You would use this, 
        for example, when doing a "bamboo" style pattern. 
      </li>
