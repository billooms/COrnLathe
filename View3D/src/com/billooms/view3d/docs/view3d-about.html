    <h2>About View3D</h2>
    <p>
      The 3D View window is for viewing the 3D bowl.
    </p>
    <h3>Using the mouse</h3>
    <p>
      To ZOOM in or out, use a 2-finger up/down motion on the trackpad to zoom out/in.
    </p>
    <p>
      To ROTATE, click and use a 1-finger motion on the trackpad to rotate the view left/right/up/down.
    </p>
    <p>
      To PAN, use a 2-finger click on the trackpad followed by a 1-finger movement on the trackpad.
    </p>
    <p>
      While rotating the view, you’ll notice that the grid moves as well, and the light sources remain stationary. 
    </p>
    <h3>Other controls</h3>
    <p>
      The “Reset” button always brings you back to the starting default viewpoint. 
    </p>
    <p>
      The “Grid” button will show or hide the 3D grid lines. 
    </p>
    <p>
      The “In/Out” button selects viewing the inside or outside surface of the shape. 
    </p>
    <p>
      The “SnapShot” button will save the view as a png file. 
    </p>
    <h3>Showing details</h3>
    <p>
      You will see the inside or outside surface of the shape. As CutPoints are added, you will 
      generally also see some black lines superimposed on the surface which are similar to a "pen chuck". 
      This is a quick and easy way to see the basic pattern of a cut.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pressing the "Render" button will show you the inside or outside of the shape with the details of the cuts. 
      Note that rendering can take a lot of computer power and might take anywhere from a few 
      seconds to many minutes. 
      Smaller resolutions (in the Outline Editor window) will take a lot more time than larger resolutions. 
      You should start with resolutions of about 0.020 for a starting point which will give a 
      reasonable trade-off between speed and resolution of the details. 
      For a final image (that you might wish to save) you can go to a resolution of 0.010. 
      Warning -- resolutions less than 0.005 will be VERY SLOW!
    </p>
    <p>
      The "Render" button is always un-selected whenever the View3D window is not open to 
      avoid rendering delays.
    </p>
    <h3>Setting the Color of the shape</h3>
    <p>
      The color of the shape can be changed by selecting "Outline" in the DataNavigator window and 
      changing the color in the Property Editor window. The color information is saved in the xml file.
    </p>
