    <h2>About CutPoints</h2>
    <p>
      A CutPoint describes how a cutter will perform at a given position. 
      There are a number of different kinds of CutPoints, 
      and they may behave in different fashions depending on the type of cutter being used.
    </p>
    <h3>Common to all CutPoints:</h3>
    <p>
      All CutPoints have a location and an option to snap to the white cutting curve (shown in the Outline Editor).
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <b>X-Location:</b> the radial distance from the centerline of the lathe.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Z-Location:</b> the distance along the axis of the lathe.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Snap:</b> this forces the CutPoint to be on the cutting curve (i.e. the white solid line shown in the 
        Outline Editor). This is the preferred setting in most situations.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Visible:</b> flag which if un-checked will keep the CutPoint from being drawn in the 
        Outline Editor window. This is mainly used when there are a lot of CutPoints and you only want 
        to view certain ones to make positioning easier. Note that this does NOT hide the CutPoint for cutting 
        purposes. Also note that this information is not saved in the file.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Cutter:</b> The cutter to use for this CutPoint. Note that one build a design using multiple 
        cutters. When generating g-code, only the CutPoints using the cutter which is selected in the 
        Outline Editor will generate g-code.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Cut Depth:</b> The total cutting depth from the at-rest position.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      What you will see in the Outline Editor is a dotted yellow line which represents the very tip of the 
      cutter at any given location. 
      You will also see a text number to help in identifying the various CutPoints. 
    </p>
    <h3>IndexPoints:</h3>
    <p>
      An IndexPoint will make cuts only at certain spindle rotations (like locking a pin on various 
      holes on an index wheel). The parameters for an IndexPoint are:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <b>Direction:</b> Describes the direction of movement:
        <ul>
          <li>
            <b>INDEX_X:</b> cutting movement is in the x-direction only
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>INDEX_Z:</b> cutting movement is in the z-direction only
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>INDEX_CURVE:</b> cutting movement is always perpendicular to the surface
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Repeat:</b> The number of cuts that are made around the rotation of the work piece.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Phase:</b> Phase shift for the cut. 
        Phase shift can be displayed in two different ways depending on how you have set 
        your preferences (see the Help topic on Preferences). 
        In "Engineering" mode, phase shift is a value between 0 and 360 degrees where 360 degrees 
        represents a full pattern shift, 180 degrees means 1/2 pattern shift, 90 degrees 
        means 1/4 pattern shift, etc. 
        Note that this is NOT the actual spindle rotation. 
        The other mode you can set in the Preferences is "Fraction" mode where 1.0 means a 
        full pattern shift, 0.5 means 1/2 pattern shift, etc.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Mask:</b> Optional information for skipping some of the index positions. 
        When left blank, all index positions are used. 
        To mask certain positions, enter a series of 0 and 1 digits. 
        A 0 (zero) means to skip the position. 
        A 1 (one) means to enable the position. 
        If the sequence of digits is shorter than the repeat value, then the sequence will 
        be used repeatedly. 
        For example -- entering 0111 with Repeat=12 will skip the 1st position, the 
        5th position, and the 9th position and use all other positions. 
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      What you see in the Outline Editor is a solid cyan arc showing the maximum depth of the cut. 
      There is also a short solid cyan line originating at the center of the IndexPoint showing the 
      depth and direction of the cut. 
    </p>
    <h3>RosettePoints:</h3>
    <p>
      A RosettePoint can have a rocking motion (most common), or a pumping motion, or both rocking and 
      pumping together (with different rosettes for each). The parameters for a RosettePoint are:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <b>Motion:</b> The direction of the motion of the rosette:
        <ul>
          <li>
            <b>ROCK:</b> Traditional rocking motion.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>PUMP:</b> Pumping motion (parallel to the axis of the spindle).
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>PERP:</b> Motion is always perpendicular to the curve of the shape. 
            Note that this is not a typical option on a traditional (analog) ornamental lathe.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>TANGENT:</b> Motion is always tangental to curve of the shape. 
            Note that this is not a typical option on a traditional (analog) ornamental lathe.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>BOTH:</b> Both rocking and pumping motion. 
            A different rosette is used for each.
          </li>
        </ul> 
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      For rosettes, you have the following parameters:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <b>Pattern:</b> See the help file on Patterns for more information on the various patterns. 
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Repeat:</b> The number of times the pattern is repeated around the perimeter of the rosette.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Amplitude:</b> The peak-to-peak amplitude of the rosette. 
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Phase:</b> Phase shift for the cut. 
        Phase shift can be displayed in two different ways depending on how you have set 
        your preferences (see the Help topic on Preferences). 
        In "Engineering" mode, phase shift is a value between 0 and 360 degrees where 360 degrees 
        represents a full pattern shift, 180 degrees means 1/2 pattern shift, 90 degrees 
        means 1/4 pattern shift, etc. 
        Note that this is NOT the actual spindle rotation. 
        The other mode you can set in the Preferences is "Fraction" mode where 1.0 means a 
        full pattern shift, 0.5 means 1/2 pattern shift, etc.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Invert</b> -- Invert the pattern on the rosette. 
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Mask:</b> Optional information for skipping some of the repeats. 
        When left blank, all repeats are used. 
        To mask certain repeat, enter a series of 0 and 1 digits. 
        A 0 (zero) means to skip the repeat. 
        A 1 (one) means to enable the repeat. 
        If the sequence of digits is shorter than the repeat value, then the sequence will 
        be used repeatedly. 
        For example -- entering 0111 with Repeat=12 will skip the 1st repeat, the 
        5th repeat, and the 9th repeat and use all other repeats. 
      </li>

      <li>
        <b>MaskPhase:</b> Optional information for shifting the point in the pattern where 
        the masking will start. 
        As with Phase above, the number is either "Engineering" mode or "Fraction" mode 
        depending on how you have set your preferences. 
        In general, when you are cutting on the inside of a shape, you will probably want to 
        start the masking at a point in the pattern where the pattern is at "1.0" in the pattern 
        editor (which corresponds to a valley on the rosette). 
        Likewise, when you are cutting on the outside of a shape, you will probably want to 
        start the masking at a point in the pattern where the pattern is at "0.0" in the pattern 
        editor (which corresponds to a peak on the rosette). 
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>MaskHiLo:</b> Flag indicating if masking causes rosette to be the highest or the lowest in the pattern. 
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>N2:</b> Some patterns use the optional <b>N2</b> parameter which is the number of small bumps within a repeat. 
        For example -- an E rosette with 5 repeats and N2=6 will have a total of 30 bumps. 
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Amplitude2:</b> Some patterns use the optional <b>Amplitude2</b> parameter which is the amplitude of the small bumps as a 
        fraction if the total amplitude. 
        For example -- a Q rosette with a total amplitude of 0.3" and amplitude2=0.2" will have small bumps that are 
        0.06" (0.3 * 0.2 = 0.06) high superimposed on the major shape.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>SymmetryAmplitude:</b> Optional information for changing the symmetry of a rosette by 
        varying the amplitude of the various repeats. 
        When left blank, there will be no variation in the amplitudes. 
        If the sequence of numbers is shorter than the repeat value, then the sequence will be used repeatedly. 
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>SymmetryWidth:</b> Optional information for changing the symmetry of a rosette by 
        varying the width of the various repeats. 
        When left blank, there will be no variation in the widths. 
        If the sequence of numbers is shorter than the repeat value, then the sequence will be used repeatedly. 
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      What you see in the Outline Editor is a solid yellow arc to indicate the maximum depth of the cut which is 
      always perpendicular to the surface. 
      There is also a short solid yellow line originating at the center of the RosettePoint showing the 
      depth and direction of the cut. 
      You will also see a solid green arc to indicate the minimum depth of the cut for 
      a given cut depth and rosette amplitude. 
      When using BOTH rocking and pumping, you will also see a solid green arc to indicate the minimum depth of 
      the rocking motion and a solid blue arc to indicate the minimum depth of the pumping motion.
    </p>
    <h3>PiercePoint:</h3>
    <p>
      This is used when you want to move a tool into the work with the spindle running 
      at a high rpm (as with plain turning). The parameters for a PiercePoint are:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <b>Direction:</b> Describes the direction of movement (similar to IndexPoints above):
        <ul>
          <li>
            <b>MOVE_X:</b> cutting movement is in the x-direction only
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>MOVE_Z:</b> cutting movement is in the z-direction only
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>MOVE_CURVE:</b> cutting movement is always perpendicular to the surface
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      What you see in the Outline Editor is a solid orange arc to indicate the maximum depth of the cut which is 
      always perpendicular to the surface. 
      There is also a short solid orange line originating at the center of the RosettePoint showing the 
      depth and direction of the cut. 
    </p>
    <h3>Various Spiral Cuts:</h3>
    <p>
      There are 3 kinds of spiral cuts: SpiralIndex, SpiralLine, and SpiralRosette. They have a start point 
      and an end point. 
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <b>End Cut Depth:</b> The cut depth may be different at the end than at the beginning. If so, 
        the depth is changed proportionally over the length of the spiral.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      See the help file on Spirals for more information on the various kinds of spirals and parameters. 
    </p>
    <p>
      The step size when moving is the value in the "Curve Resolution" field of the Outline Editor window. 
      For smooth cuts, you will want something on the order of 0.030" or less. 
      Note that this type of can will take a long time to render even on the more powerful computers. 
    </p>
    <h3>SpiralIndex:</h3>
    <p>
      The SpiralIndex CutPoint starts cutting at a number of points around the work piece (just like the IndexPoint above). 
      Then it moves along the outside of the shape (following the white cut curve in the Outline Editor) 
      while the spindle is rotating. 
      This produces simple fluting (when twist=0) or it can produce a variety of spiral cuts.
    </p>
    <p>
      The parameters for the starting point are the same as for IndexPoint listed above. 
    </p>
    <p>
      What you see in the Outline Editor is a starting IndexPoint and a separate end point 
      (with the same text number ending with "E"). 
      The end point can be moved independent of the start point. 
      (Note that initially, the end point will be coincident with the start point until you move it.)
    </p>
    <h3>SpiralRosette:</h3>
    <p>
      The SpiralRosette CutPoint starts cutting with a rosette just (like the RosettePoint above). 
      Then it moves along the outside of the shape (following the white cut curve in the Outline Editor) 
      while the spindle is rotating. 
      This produces a rosette pattern that varies smoothly as it spirals around the piece. 
    </p>
    <p>
      The parameters for the starting point are the same as for RosettePoint listed above. 
    </p>
    <p>
      If the starting depth is the same as the amplitude of the rosette (either rocking amplitude or 
      pumping amplitude) and the end depth is different from the starting depth, then the rosette 
      amplitude will be tapered as well.
      If you desire a taper in the depth without changing the amplitude of the rosette, then make 
      one of them slightly different and the rosette amplitude will not be tapered.
    </p>
    <p>
      What you see in the Outline Editor is a starting RosettePoint and a separate end point 
      (with the same text number ending with "E"). 
      The end point can be moved independent of the start point. 
      (Note that initially, the end point will be coincident with the start point until you move it.)
    </p>
    <h3>SpiralLine:</h3>
    <p>
      The SpiralLine CutPoint starts cutting at a number of points around the work piece (similar to the SpiralIndex above). 
      Then it moves along the outside of the shape (following the white cut curve in the Outline Editor) 
      while the spindle is rotating forward and reverse to create a wave pattern in the line similar to 
      what is produced on a straight line machine. The pattern is controlled by a PatternBar.
    </p>
    <p>
      The parameters for the starting LinePoint are: 
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <b>Repeat:</b> The number of lines that are made around the rotation of the work piece.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Phase:</b> Phase shift for the lines. 
        Phase shift can be displayed in two different ways depending on how you have set 
        your preferences (see the Help topic on Preferences). 
        In "Engineering" mode, phase shift is a value between 0 and 360 degrees where 360 degrees 
        represents a full pattern shift, 180 degrees means 1/2 pattern shift, 90 degrees 
        means 1/4 pattern shift, etc. 
        Note that this is NOT the actual spindle rotation. 
        The other mode you can set in the Preferences is "Fraction" mode where 1.0 means a 
        full pattern shift, 0.5 means 1/2 pattern shift, etc.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Mask:</b> Optional information for skipping some of the line positions. 
        When left blank, all line positions are used. 
        To mask certain positions, enter a series of 0 and 1 digits. 
        A 0 (zero) means to skip the position. 
        A 1 (one) means to enable the position. 
        If the sequence of digits is shorter than the repeat value, then the sequence will 
        be used repeatedly. 
        For example -- entering 0111 with Repeat=12 will skip the 1st position, the 
        5th position, and the 9th position and use all other positions. 
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      For a PatternBar, you have the following parameters:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <b>Pattern:</b> See the help file on Patterns for more information on the various patterns. 
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Amplitude:</b> The peak-to-peak amplitude of the PatternBar. 
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Period:</b> The distance before the pattern repeats.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Phase:</b> Phase shift for the cut. 
        Phase shift can be displayed in two different ways depending on how you have set 
        your preferences (see the Help topic on Preferences). 
        In "Engineering" mode, phase shift is a value between 0 and 360 degrees where 360 degrees 
        represents a full pattern shift, 180 degrees means 1/2 pattern shift, 90 degrees 
        means 1/4 pattern shift, etc. 
        Note that this is NOT the actual spindle rotation. 
        The other mode you can set in the Preferences is "Fraction" mode where 1.0 means a 
        full pattern shift, 0.5 means 1/2 pattern shift, etc.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Invert</b> -- Invert the pattern on the PatternBar. 
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>N2:</b> Some patterns use the optional <b>N2</b> parameter which is the number of small bumps within a repeat. 
        For example -- an E pattern with 5 repeats and N2=6 will have a total of 30 bumps. 
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Amplitude2:</b> Some patterns use the optional <b>Amplitude2</b> parameter which is the amplitude of the small bumps as a 
        fraction if the total amplitude. 
        For example -- a Q pattern with a total amplitude of 0.3" and amplitude2=0.2" will have small bumps that are 
        0.06" (0.3 * 0.2 = 0.06) high superimposed on the major shape.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      What you see in the Outline Editor is a starting LinePoint and a separate end point 
      (with the same text number ending with "E"). 
      The end point can be moved independent of the start point. 
      (Note that initially, the end point will be coincident with the start point until you move it.)
    </p>
    <h3>GoToPoint:</h3>
    <p>
      A GoToPoint does not do any cutting. It merely directs the motion of the cutter when moving from 
      one CutPoint to another. This is typically used when you need to go around a convex curve section 
      of the work. If no GoToPoints occur between two CutPoints, the movement of the cutter is a 
      straight line from one to the next. 
    </p>
    <p>
      A GoToPoint has cutter information so that when there are multiple cutters we can filter only those 
      GoToPoints that are required for a given cutter's CutPoints. 
    </p>
    <p>
      GoToPoints may also be used to direct the motion of the cutter from the end of a SpiralLine or 
      SpiralIndex CutPoint back to the beginning of the CutPoint. This is often needed to prevent the 
      cutter from hitting a portion of the work as multiple spirals are being cut. To add GoToPoints
      to a SpiralLine or SpiralIndex, first add one or more GoToPoints, then drag/drop them onto the end point 
      of the SpiralLine or SpiralIndex in the order that should be followed. Note that after the last cut of 
      such a spiral the cutter does NOT follow these GoToPoints but the cutter remains at the end of the 
      last spiral.
    </p>
    <h3>Various Offset CutPoints:</h3>
    <p>
      Offset CutPoints include a PatternPoint and an OffsetGroup (one or more RosettePoints).  
    </p>
    <p>
      Offset CutPoints are used to cut the work when it is held in a dome or eccentric chuck. 
      The location of the Offset CutPoint becomes the top/center of the work when it is positioned 
      by the dome/eccentric chuck.  
    </p>
    <p>
      For an Offset CutPoint, you have the following parameters:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <b>Repeat:</b> The number of cuts that are made around the rotation of the work piece (as with 
        an eccentric chuck). Valid values for repeat can be any sub-multiple of 24 or 35 (the rotation 
        is indexed with 24 or 35 holes).
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>IndexOffset:</b> The number of holes to skip before starting the repeats.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      What you see in the Outline Editor is a pink line that is tangental to the surface, and a pink 
      line that is perpendicular to the surface. When the work is positioned in the dome/eccentric chuck, the 
      line perpendicular to the surface is brought to the center of rotation of the spindle.
    </p>
    <h3>PatternPoint:</h3>
    <p>
      A PatternPoint is used to cut a pattern around the point of rotation. It is to be used with a 
      Horizontal Cutting Frame (HCF) and a custom pattern that is made from an outline of a shape (like 
      a leaf or butterfly).   
    </p>
    <p>
      For a PatternPoint, you have the following parameters:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <b>Pattern:</b> This is usually a custom pattern.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>PatternRepeat:</b> The number of times the pattern is repeated (usually this is set to one). 
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Phase:</b> Phase shift for the pattern. 
        Phase shift can be displayed in two different ways depending on how you have set 
        your preferences (see the Help topic on Preferences). 
        In "Engineering" mode, phase shift is a value between 0 and 360 degrees where 360 degrees 
        represents a full pattern shift, 180 degrees means 1/2 pattern shift, 90 degrees 
        means 1/4 pattern shift, etc. 
        Note that this is NOT the actual spindle rotation. 
        The other mode you can set in the Preferences is "Fraction" mode where 1.0 means a 
        full pattern shift, 0.5 means 1/2 pattern shift, etc.

        <b>Optimize:</b> A flag indicating that the depth of the cut be adjusted based on the curvature 
        of the shape to reduce the distortion of the pattern due to curvature. 
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      A custom pattern is made from the outline of some shape with radial symmetry. Measure the radial 
      distance for various rotations from 0 to 360 degrees. Then scale the pattern to a horizontal scale 
      ranging from 0 to 1 and a vertical scale of 0 to 1.   
    </p>
    <p>
      When the pattern has a value of zero, no cut is made. When the pattern 
      has a value of one, then the cutter will be at the specified cut depth. For other pattern 
      values, the depth and position of the cutter is adjusted 
      during spindle rotation so that the cut spans the distance from the center of rotation to the point 
      indicated by the pattern. Thus the PatternPoint will reproduce outline of the shape that was 
      used as a basis for the pattern. 
    </p>
    <p>
      A custom pattern may also have dual lines. In that case, there are two pattern points for each position. 
      The first point would be positive and represent the outline of the shape as described above. 
      The second point can be negative and indicates that the extent of the cut is from some other point other 
      than the center of rotation. This can be used, for example, for accentuating the stem on a leaf pattern.
    </p>
    <p>
      What you see in the Outline Editor is a pink arc indicating the maximum cut depth, and green arcs 
      on either side of the perpendicular pink line to show the extent of the cut.

    <h3>OffsetGroup:</h3>
    <p>
      The OffsetGroup allows you to add one or more RosettePoints to the group. First drag and drop an 
      OffsetGroup from the pallet. Then drag and drop one or more RosettePoints onto the curve, and then 
      drag/drop the RosettePoints onto the center of the OffsetGroup. Now the RosettePoint is part of the 
      group and can be positioned as desired relative to the group. 
    </p>
    <p>
      What you see in the Outline Editor is similar to a regular RosettePoint, but the arcs are mirrored on 
      either side of the pink lines indicating the origin of the group.
    </p>
    <h3>Changing the order of CutPoints:</h3>
    <p>
      The order of the CutPoints can be changed in the DataNavigator window. 
      Select a CutPoint, then right-click (Mac CTRL-click) and choose "Move Up" or 
      "Move Down" to move that CutPoint's position in the list. 
      You can also use the keyboard shortcuts (which can be changed in the Preferences window).
