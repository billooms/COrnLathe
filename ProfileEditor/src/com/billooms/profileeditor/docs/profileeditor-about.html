    <h2>ProfileEditor</h2>
    <p>
      The Profile Editor allows you to quickly create your own cutter profile. 
      The display shows the outline of the cutter tip -- the orientation is such that 
      the shank of the cutter is up, and the point of the cutter is down. 
      The line in the center of the window represents the center of the cutter. 
      As changes are made, you will see a small icon below the profile selection box. 
    </p>
    <p>
      Important -- for the software to work properly, the bottom point must go all the 
      way down to the bottom line in the display window. Also, the width of the curve 
      you enter must go all the way to the left line and all the way to the right line. 
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <b>New Profile</b> -- This creates a new profile with the name that you provide. 
        You have the option of creating the outline with straight lines between the points 
        or curve-fit lines between the points.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Adding Points</b> -- Double click on the display window to add a point. 
        To move a point, click near it and drag it to a new location. 
        To delete a point, drag it off the display area. 
        Points are in sorted order from left to right. 
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Manually editing points</b> -- you can manually edit the precise positions of the 
        coordinates by using the DataNavigator Window together with the Properties Window. 
        Click on "Profiles:" and expand the listing to see all the points. 
        When you select a point, you will be able to manually edit the coordinates in the 
        "Properties" window. 
        See the Help file on the DataNavigator Window for more information.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Normalize</b> -- This re-adjusts the curve you entered so that the bottom point 
        goes exactly to the bottom and the left and right sides go all the way to the edges. 
        This is important for the software to work properly. 
        You should always use the Normalize function at the end of all edits. 
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>L<-R Mirror</b> -- This takes the points on the right half of the display and mirrors 
        them to the left side of the display. 
        Any prior points on the left side of the display are deleted. 
        This is a convenient way to make a symmetrical cutter profile.  
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Clear</b> -- Clear all points and start over again. 
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Delete</b> -- Delete this profile.  
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      The built-in profiles cannot be edited or deleted. 
    </p>
    <p>
      You can also write a short program for your own custom profiles and have them 
      permanently added to your copy of the software. 
      This enables you do write a profile module and share it with 
      other users of this software.
