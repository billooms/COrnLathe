    <h2>About COrnLathe XML Files</h2>
    <p>
      Information is saved in files using an .xml file format. 
      This is a somewhat human-readable format that can be edited by any text editor with care. 
      A document type definition (dtd) for the file is available at 
      <a href="http://www.billooms.com/dtds/cornlathe3_0.dtd">www.billooms.com/dtds/cornlathe3_0.dtd</a>.
      The second line in the xml files contains a link to this file. 
      Your editor understands xml formats, it will have a command to validate that the edits you made conform to the 
      rules in the dtd file.
    </p>
    <h2>Favorites Window</h2>
    <p>
      The best way to gain access to your files is with the "Favorites" window within the program. 
      You can mark certain directories as being a favorite so that you don't have to navigate your 
      way through the entire file structure. 
    </p>
    <p>
      To create a new file, right click (or 2-finger click with a touchpad) on a directory and select "New", 
      then select "COrnTemplate.xml" and give it a new name. 
    </p>
    <p>
      To open a file, simply double click it's name. Other options appear when you do a right click (or 2-finger click 
      on a touchpad). Note that you can open the xml file in a text editor within the program by choosing "Open" 
      on the option menu. You can also choose "Revert to Saved" to go back to the last saved version of the file.  
    </p>
    <h2>File Menu Actions</h2>
    <p>
      Many of the menu items are standard on most programs:
