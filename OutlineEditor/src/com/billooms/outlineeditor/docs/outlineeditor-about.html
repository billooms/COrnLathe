    <h2>OutlineEditor</h2>
    <p>
      The Outline Editor window is the main editing window to change the outline of the work 
      and the location of cuts. It also allows you to change information about the cutter being used. 
      For more information on the cutter parameters, see the Help section on Cutters. 
    </p>
    <p>
      Just below the editing window at the far left, you select whether you are editing 
      the Outline or you wish to edit CutPoints. 
      To the right of that you see the location of the cursor at any time, along with 
      any measured distance (the distance between pressing the mouse button and lifting the mouse button). 
      On the far right edge is the total length of the curve (either inside or outside, 
      depending on where the cutter is located).
    </p>
    <p>
      You can change the thickness of your bowl by setting a new value for the "Thickness" field. 
    </p>
    <p>
      The "Resolution" field is the over-all accuracy of the outline (and the 3D shape). 
      A good number for this is around 0.020". 
      Values below 0.005" will result in much slower response time when rendering a 3D cut surface. 
      However, for very fine patterns you may need to set this to a small value to see the details 
      of your cut surface.
    </p>
    <p>
      You have the option of showing CutPoints for all cutters (when multiple cutters are used) or 
      show only the CutPoints which use the selected cutter.
    </p>
    <p>
      The "Offset" button is enabled after digitizing points from the stage (probing the surface). 
      Such points represent the center of the cutter which is not the outline of the shape (when using 
      an HCF or UCF cutting frame). Pressing this button will correct the curve after all points of the 
      shape have been probed. 
    </p>
    <p>
      The panel on the bottom is for editing Cutter information. You can select which cutter is 
      being used. See the Help file on Cutters for more information on the other cutter parameters. 
    </p>
    <h3>Maneuvering</h3>
    <p>
      To zoom in/out, use the scroll wheel on your mouse or two-finger up/down on a trackpad. 
      To pan, do a right click and move the mouse or control-click on a trackpad (two-finger click followed by 
      one finger drag). 
      Command-F (on a Mac) will zoom to fit the curve in the window.
    </p>
    <h3>Editing outline points</h3>
    <p>
      There are several different curves that you might see in the window:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        The inside surface is a purple/magenta color.
      </li>
      <li>
        The outside surface is an orange/tan color.
      </li>
      <li>
        A solid white line indicates the path of the cutter. 
        CutPoints will snap onto this path (unless snap is disabled fot that CutPoint).
      </li>
      <li>
        A light dotted gray line with round dots is the curve-fitted line that determines 
        the shape of the work. The dots are the points which you entered and can move. 
        These digitized points might be on the path of the cutter (for files imported from 
        older versions of RESurface). 
        On new shapes that are digitized by clicking with the mouse, these will be 
        points on either the inside or outside of the curve (depending on where the cutter is 
        when you first start making the shape). 
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      To enter a point in the "Edit Outline" mode, simply double-click where you want the new point to go. 
      To move a point, click on it and drag it somewhere else. 
      To remove a point, drag it outside the window and it will go away.
    </p>
    <p>
      Points should be entered starting at the bottom.
      As you enter additional points, they are in sorted order from bottom to top.
      If you want a point that is out of this order (as when you have a rim of a bowl that
      recurves downward), first enter the point up higher (to get it in proper sequence)
      then drag it down to where you want it.
    </p>
    <p>
      To get tighter curves, put points closer together.
      For example, one can approximate a corner by using a very tight curve
      with several points close together.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you see funny kinks in your curves, this is generally an indication that you won't 
      be able to cut that shape with a cutter of the given radius. 
      For example, you can't make a shape with an internal curvature that is a smaller radius 
      than your cutter. 
      Also, going around the outside edge of a corner can give an unusual appearance.
    </p>
    <h3>Menu for the "Outline"</h3>
    <p>
      The menu bar has several items that only relate to the Outline Editor:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <b>2Pts: Vertical</b> -- If you only have 2 points, this will make them perfectly vertical.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>2Pts: Horizontal</b> -- If you only have 2 points, this will make them perfectly horizontal.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Offset Curve...</b> -- This brings up a menu with several options. 
        You can move all the curves vertically so that the top or bottom of the selected curve is zero. 
        Alternately you can move all the curves vertically so that the top or bottom of 
        the selected curve is at a specified location. 
        You can also move the curves perpendicular to the curvature with a given offset.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Invert</b> -- Inverts the shape (i.e. turns it upside-down).
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Clear CutPoints</b> -- Deletes all CutPoints, leaving the outline.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Clear All</b> -- Clears the CutPoints and the outline (for a fresh start).
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Zoom to Fit</b> -- The window is zoomed in or out so that the curves fit nicely within the window.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Spiral to Cutpoints</b> -- A SpiralRosette or SpiralIndex can be converted to a number of discrete RosettePoints or 
        IndexPoints with some uniform spacing. The spacing can be uniform in X, uniform in Z, or uniform in distance following 
        the spiral.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Editing CutPoints</h3>
    <p>
      To add a CutPoint in the "Edit CutPoints" mode, select the desired CutPoint on the pallet and 
      double-click close to the white line (which is the path of the cutter). 
      The added CutPoint will snap to the curve. 
      Alternately, drag and drop a CutPoint from the pallet to a point close to the white line. 
      The first CutPoint will have default values which can be edited by selecting the CutPoint in the 
      DataNavigator and editing the properties in the Property Editor. 
      Additional CutPoints with the edited values can be added by simply double-clicking at the desired 
      location. The most recently added CutPoint will be duplicated at the new position.
      To move a CutPoint, click on it and drag it somewhere else. 
      To remove a CutPoint, drag it outside the window and it will go away. 
    </p>

      see the Help section on CutPoints.
