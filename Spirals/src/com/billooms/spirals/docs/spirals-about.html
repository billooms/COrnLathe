    <h2>Built-In Spirals</h2>
    <p>
      Various kinds of spirals are used by SpiralRosette, SpiralIndex, and SpiralLine CutPoints. 
      The following spirals are "built-in" to the software. 
      A user may program their own spirals and make them permanent additions to 
      their copy of the software (or distribute them as plug-ins to others).
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <b>UNIFORMZ:</b> The angle varies as a function of height (z-distance).
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>UNIFORMD:</b> The angle varies uniformly with the distance traveled.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>PROPORTION:</b> The angle varies more at big diameters than small diameters.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>SINE:</b> Superimpose a sine wave on a UNIFORM_D spiral. 
        The amplitude of the sine wave is entered in the "Spiral Amplitude" field and can be 
        positive or negative.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>SIN4:</b> Superimpose a quarter of a sine wave on a UNIFORM_D spiral.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>COS4:</b> Superimpose a quarter of a cosine wave on a UNIFORM_D spiral.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      In addition to selecting the style of the spiral, there are additional parameters:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <b>Twist:</b> This is the total twist of the spiral. 
        It is measured in total rotation of the spindle in degrees (not relative to the number of repeats).
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Amplitude:</b> This optional amplitude is used by the SINE spiral to indicate the 
        amplitude of the superimposed sine wave (may be positive or negative).
      </li>
    </ul>
