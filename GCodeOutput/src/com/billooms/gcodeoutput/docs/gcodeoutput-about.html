    <h2>Hardware Preferences</h2>
    <p>
      The Preferences are found under the Preferences menu item (Mac users) 
      or under the "Tools --> Options" menu (PC and UNIX). 
      These must be set to match your hardware configuration in order to 
      have optimum results when generating instructions. 
      The settings for your XZ stage might be different from your settings on 
      the spindle (C-axis), so both must be set. 
      Once set, these preferences are saved for later use each time you open 
      the software.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <b>Stepper Motor:</b> Stepper motors are generally either 200 steps 
        per rotation (1.8 degree per step) or 400 steps per rotation (0.9 
        degree per step). 
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>MicroStepping:</b> Stepper motor drives often allow the ability 
        to micro-step which gives greater resolution. 
        If your stepper driver does not have this option, select "1 step". 
        Otherwise, select the appropriate micro-stepping value. 
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Small Gear:</b> Typically you will want to have a pulley on the 
        spindle stepper motor with fewer teeth than on the spindle. 
        This gives you more torque on the spindle and greater resolution. 
        Enter the number of teeth on the small pulley on the stepper motor.  
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Large Gear:</b> Enter the number of teeth on the large pulley on the spindle.  
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Turns per Inch:</b> Enter the number of turns per inch on the lead 
        screw on the X and Z stages. 
        Note that this might not be the same as the number of threads per 
        inch in the event that your lead screw has multiple starts.   
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Location and name of g-code output file</h2>
    <p>
      The default location for the generated g-code file is in the same directory 
      as the .xml file. 
      The name is the same as the .xml file, but will have an extension of .ngc 
      (which is the standard for LinuxCNC software). 
    </p>
    <p>
      You have the option of selecting a single file that will always be used with 
      the same name each time. 
      For example, this might be on a different computer on the network which is 
      running the LinuxCNC software. 
      This makes it easy to simply re-load the file each time something is changed. 
      Note that with this option, you will not be asked prior to over-writing the file. 
    </p>
    <p>
      You can set the maximum number of g-code instructions that can be executed per second. 
      In reality, LinuxCNC can only compute a trajectory at some maximum number of points per second 
      which is a function of the speed of the CPU and other factors. 
      This generally will come into play when cutting from rosettes at the maximum precision where 
      a g-code instruction is generated for each micro-step of the spindle (C-axis).  
      You can determine how fast your LinuxCNC machine can execute commands by setting this parameter to some high number 
      (like 500) and then cutting a single rotation of a rosette with maximum resolution at a high rpm (like 10RPM). 
      Note how many seconds it actually takes to cut the rotation. 
      The number of g-code instructions per second that your system is capable of handling 
      is the number of micro-steps per revolution of the 
      spindle (C-axis) divided by the number of seconds to do the cut. 
    </p>
    <h2>LinuxCNC IP address</h2>
    <p>
      If you wish to probe points from the actual position of your XZ stage, check the "Connect to LinuxCNC" box. 
      Then enter the IP address of your LinuxCNC computer. 
      Note that some routers may assign a different IP address every time the system is turned on. 
      You can change that in your router setup so that it always assigns a given IP address to each machine. 
    </p>
    <h2>GCode Output</h2>
    <p>
      There are 3 options for writing g-code. 
      The first (and most commonly used) is cutting patterns from rosettes. 
      You can also cut the contour of a shape, or cut threads.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Important!</b> Since this software has no knowledge of the actual position of the stages, the user 
      must assure that the stages are positioned so that the first g-code command 
      executed (going to the first CutPoint) will not cause the cutter to interfere with 
      the work.
    </p>
    <p>
      To write the g-code file, press the "Write G-Code" button in the GCode Control Window. 
      The file will have the same name as your .xml file, but will have the suffix ".ngc".
      Alternately, you can always write to a specific file on a networked LinuxCNC computer (see 
      Hardware Preferences above). 
      Most of the g-code instructions use inverse time mode (g93) to assure that both the 
      maximum rpm and the maximum velocities are not exceeded. 
      When the spindle turns a full rotation, it is set to zero (without turning back) by the 
      use of the g92 offset command. 
      At the end of the file, a g92.1 command is given to clear any offsets that have been 
      accumulated. 
      The user needs to be aware of how these commands operate. 
    </p>
    <h3>Feed Rates</h3>
    <p>
      When generating g-code, the software needs to know the maximum feed rate 
      on both the linear stages (X-axis and Z-axis) and on the spindle (C-axis). 
      Values can be entered by moving the slider with the mouse, selecting the 
      text in the display field and typing in a new value, or placing the 
      cursor in the display field and rotating the mouse scroll wheel.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <b>RPM:</b> Enter the desired maximum rpm on the spindle (C-axis). 
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Velocity:</b> Enter the desired maximum velocity on the X-axis 
        and Z-axis (inches per minute).
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Note that this software is set up with a maximum spindle speed of 10 rpm, 
      and a maximum linear stage speed of 15 inches per minute. 
    </p>
    <h3>Cutting Rosettes</h3>
    <p>
      When cutting from the rosettes, it is generally best to make multiple 
      coarse cuts followed by a final fine cut. 
      You can enter the depth of the coarse cuts and the depth of the final cut. 
      Note that the final depth of the cut is specified on each CutPoint and 
      the final depth will be broken down into the appropriate number of coarse 
      and fine cuts. 
      You also have the option to specify the number of stepper motor micro-steps 
      for each generated g-code command. 
      You might use a larger value for the coarse cuts and a smaller value for the 
      final cut. 
      You can choose to have all the cuts in the same direction, or to have the last 
      cut in the opposite direction. 
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <b>Depth per Pass:</b> The depth of each coarse cut. 
        Typical values are often in the range of 0.020 to 0.030 inch.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Micro-Steps per instruction:</b> The number of stepper micro-steps per 
        each generated instruction. 
        The equivalent number of "Degrees per step" is displayed. 
        A value that gives about 0.15 degrees per step might be good for coarse cuts. 
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Final Cut Depth:</b> This is the depth of the final fine cut. 
        Note that this is not the total cut depth (which is specified for each CutPoint).  
        A typical value is 0.005 inch.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Micro-Steps per instruction:</b> The number of stepper micro-steps per 
        each generated instruction. 
        The equivalent number of "Degrees per step" is displayed. 
        For best resolution, you would set this to "1".
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Soft Lift:</b> (optional) Gradually lift the cutter the specified distance 
        over some number of degrees rotation. 
        This can be used with a fixed cutter to avoid a line when the cutter is withdrawn.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Soft Lift Height:</b> The distance to lift the cutter.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Soft Lift Rotation:</b> The cutter is gradually lifted over the specified degrees rotation.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Direction of Rotation:</b> The rotation can be always positive (counterclockwise), 
        always negative (clockwise) or positive on roughing cuts and negative on the final 
        and cleanup cuts.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      <b>Important!</b> When cutting on a convex surface, you MUST provide a safe path for the cutter 
      to go from one CutPoint to the next! 
      Otherwise, after making the a cut, the cutter might run into the surface of your shape! 
      "GoToPoints" are entered in the Outline Editor in the "Edit CutPoint" mode by right clicking. 
      These "GoToPoints" are displayed in red and are numbered. 
      Since CutPoints are cut in the order they are entered, any "GoToPoints" you enter will provide 
      a path when going from one CutPoint to the next.
    </p>
    <h3>Cutting Contours</h3>
    <p>
      This is useful when you want to rough out a shape and use the ornamental lathe to complete the final shape. 
      It is also useful when making closely nested shapes. 
      The user can specify how coarse of a step to take (which is independent of the display resolution 
      used in the Outline Editor window). 
      At each point on the curve, one complete turn is made at the specified rpm.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <b>Step Size:</b> The approximate distance moved on the outline for each cut. 
        Typical values are often in the range of 0.020 to 0.100 inch.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Backoff:</b> How far to back away (from the final surface) when making the first cut. 
        For example, if you have roughed out the shape to within about 0.1" of the final contour, 
        you may want to backoff 0.100" on the first cut. 
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Direction of cut:</b> Either "First to Last" or "Last to First".
        Note that this refers to the order that points are entered in the outline. 
        You can view the order of the points in the DataNavigator window.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Number of coarse cuts:</b> The number of coarse cut passes (which can be zero).
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Depth of coarse cuts:</b> The incremental depth of each coarse cut pass (which can be zero).
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Number of fine cuts:</b> The number of fine cut passes (which can be zero).
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Depth of fine cuts:</b> The incremental depth of each fine cut pass (which can be zero).
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Note that you need at least one coarse or fine cut (or nothing will be cut). 
      You might only have one cut of zero depth with no back-off, which will cut the surface as drawn. 
      The total number of passes (with the total cut depth relative to the drawn surface) is displayed.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Important!</b> When cutting on a convex surface, you MUST provide a safe path for the cutter 
      to go from the end back to the beginning when taking multiple passes! 
      Otherwise, after making the first path, the cutter might run into the surface of your shape! 
      Safe paths are entered in the Outline Editor in the "Edit Outline" mode by right clicking. 
      These "safe path" points are displayed in red.
    </p>
    <h3>Cutting Threads</h3>
    <p>
      Threads may only be cut on a vertical surface (i.e. two points in the outline with the same X-coordinate). 
      Threads are conveniently cut by the use of a thread cutter or 60 degree angle cutter in a drilling frame.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <b>Threads per Inch:</b> The number of threads per inch. 
        The pitch is displayed for convenience (but the pitch field cannot be manually changed). 
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Starts:</b> The number of starts for the threads. 
        This is usually "1", but if you want faster threads (such as on the lid of a box), you can set this to a higher value. 
        Note that the "turns per inch" will be the "Threads per Inch" divided by the number of starts. 
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>%:</b> The percentage of engagement in the threads. 
        A typical number would be 60%. 
        See the figure below for more information and a description of the other dimensions displayed.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Female ID:</b> Enter a number here for the inside dimension of the female recess, 
        and the outside dimensions of the male tenon will be calculated and displayed.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Male OD:</b> Enter a number here for the outside dimension of the male tenon, 
        and the inside dimensions of the female recess will be calculated and displayed.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>LinuxCNC Connection</h3>
    <p>
      If you have set up your preferences to allow probing the actual position of the XZ stage, then 
      this panel will show that the connection is active. 
      When you press the "Probe" button, the actual position of the XZ stage is read and used as 
      the coordinate for adding an outline point (if the EditorWindow is in "Edit Outline" mode) 
      or used as the coordinate for adding a CutPoint (if the Editor Window is in the "Edit CutPoints" mode). 
      The probed position is shown in the panel for convenience.
