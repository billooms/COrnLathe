    <h2>Patterns</h2>
    <p>
      Each rosette has a specified pattern which describes the fundamental shape of each lobe.
      Although users with traditional machines may prefer the "A, B, C..." designation,
      many newcomers find the nomenclature to be difficult to remember as it is not descriptive.
      This program attempts to use more descriptive terms for the rosette patterns. 
      A full collection of the traditional Holtzapffel patterns is also available.
    </p>
    <p>
      Any pattern may be inverted by checking the "invert" box in the property editor.
    </p>
    <p>
      The following patterns are "built-in" to the software. 
      Additional patterns may be added by the user (see the help file on the Pattern Editor). 
      Also, a user may program their own patterns and make them permanent additions to their 
      copy of the software (or distribute them as plug-ins to others). 
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <img src="None.png" width="50" height="50" align="middle">
        <b>NONE</b> is just a plain round circle with no bumps or lobes.
      </li>
      <li>
        <img src="Nside.png" width="50" height="50" align="middle">
        <b>NSIDE</b> is similar to a <b>C</b> rosette on traditional rose engines.
        It is made from an n-sided polygon (i.e. triangle, square, pentagon, hexagon, etc).
        At some amplitude, it will accurately reproduce the n-sided polygon.
      </li>
      <li>
        <img src="Flower.png" width="50" height="50" align="middle">
        <b>FLOWER</b> is similar to a <b>D</b> rosette on traditional rose engines.
        It is the inverse of the <b>N-Side</b> rosette.
        That is, you get the same effect from rubbing on the front side of a <b>Flower</b> rosette
        as you get by rubbing on the back of an <b>N-Side</b> rosette.
      </li>
      <li>
        <img src="Sine.png" width="50" height="50" align="middle">
        <b>SINE</b> is similar to an <b>A</b> rosette on traditional rose engines.
        The lobes are defined by a sine wave function.
      </li>
      <li>
        <img src="HalfSine.png" width="50" height="50" align="middle">
        <b>HALFSINE</b> is the first half of a sine wave.
      </li>
      <li>
        <img src="Heart.png" width="50" height="50" align="middle">
        <b>HEART</b> is similar to an <b>F</b> rosette on traditional rose engines.
        With a single repeat, it will show a traditional heart shape.
        With more repeats, the heart pattern is repeated around the rosette.
      </li>
      <li>
        <img src="Lotus.png" width="50" height="50" align="middle">
        <b>LOTUS</b> is similar to the lotus pattern on a rosette made for the MDF rose engine by Jon Magill.
      </li>
      <li>
        <img src="BigSmall.png" width="50" height="50" align="middle">
        <b>BIGSMALL</b> is similar to a <b>B</b> rosette on traditional rose engines.
        The larger lobe consumes 2/3 of the pattern repeat distance,
        and the smaller lobe consumes 1/3 of the pattern repeat distance.
        Each lobe is the same as a <b>Flower</b> lobe.
      </li>
      <li>
        <img src="Triangle.png" width="50" height="50" align="middle">
        <b>TRIANGLE</b> is a simple triangle that is "bent" around the round shape of a rosette.
      </li>
      <li>
        <img src="Tudor.png" width="50" height="50" align="middle">
        <b>TUDOR</b> is inspired by a traditional tudor rose pattern.
        Although the traditional pattern has 5 repeats, the user is free to specify any number of repeats around the rosette.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Holtzapffel Patterns</h2>
    <p>
      For those who prefer using the Holtzapffel rosette system, I've added the full library of lettered rosettes.
      For more details on the Holtzapffel rosettes, John Edwards has spent a lot of time documenting the characteristics of the 
      various rosettes on historic machines. 
      Also, John Tarpley recently published an excellent article on rosettes in the Lindow newsletter (Vol 3, Number 1). 
    </p>
    <p>
      The numbering system used with the Holtzapffel rosettes is inconsistent. 
      Computers don't like inconsistencies in handling parameters. 
      So for the purpose of this program the following guidelines are used:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        The <b>amplitude</b> parameter is always the maximum amplitude of the total pattern. 
      </li>
      <li>
        The <b>repeat</b> parameter is always the number of repetitions of the total pattern. 
      </li>
      <li>
        Some patterns use the optional <b>n2</b> parameter which is the number of small bumps within a repeat. 
        For example -- an E rosette with 5 repeats and n2=6 will have a total of 30 bumps. 
      </li>
      <li>
        Some patterns use the optional <b>amplitude2</b> parameter which is the amplitude of the small bumps as a 
        fraction if the total amplitude. 
        For example -- a Q rosette with a total amplitude of 0.3" and amplitude2=0.2" will have small bumps that are 
        0.06" (0.3 * 0.2 = 0.06) high superimposed on the major shape.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Note that these rosettes are very close approximations to the historic Holtzapffel rosettes. 
      There is insufficient documentation to reproduce the exact patterns without digitizing the actual historic rosettes. 
      Following is a list of the lettered Holtzapffel rosettes:
