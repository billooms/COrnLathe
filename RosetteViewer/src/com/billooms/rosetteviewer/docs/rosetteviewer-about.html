    <h2>RosetteViewer</h2>
    <p>
      The RosetteViewer window is useful for visualizing the appearance of a rosette. 
      Note that this is not used for setting the parameters of a particular rosette used 
      in a CutPoint. 
      It's just a way to look at a rosette and can print out the coordinates for 
      actually making a rosette.
    </p>
    <h3>Rosette Parameters</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <b>Pattern</b> -- The pattern to be used for the rosette. 
        You can select from a number of built-in patterns or build your own pattern with 
        the Pattern Editor. 
        You can also write your own brief software description of a pattern and have it 
        permanently added to your version of the software (or share it with others). 
        See the Help file for Patterns and the Pattern Editor for more details. 
        A small plot of a single repeat of the pattern is shown below the selector box. 
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Repeat</b> -- The number of times the pattern is repeated around the rosette. 
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Invert</b> -- Invert the pattern on the rosette. 
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>N2:</b> Some patterns use the optional <b>N2</b> parameter which is the number of small bumps within a repeat. 
        For example -- an E rosette with 5 repeats and N2=6 will have a total of 30 bumps. 
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Amplitude2:</b> Some patterns use the optional <b>Amplitude2</b> parameter which is the amplitude of the small bumps as a 
        fraction if the total amplitude. 
        For example -- a Q rosette with a total amplitude of 0.3" and amplitude2=0.2" will have small bumps that are 
        0.06" (0.3 * 0.2 = 0.06) high superimposed on the major shape.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Peak-to-peak Amplitude</b> -- The maximum deflection from a rosette. 
        This is the difference between the maximum radius and the minimum radius of the rosette. 
        The amplitude can be set by sliding the slider, by selecting the text in the value field 
        and typing in a new value, or by positioning the cursor in the value field and 
        rotating the scroll wheel on your mouse. 
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Phase</b> -- The phase shift of the rosette. 
        Phase shift can be displayed in two different ways depending on how you have set 
        your preferences (see the Help topic on Preferences). 
        In "Engineering" mode, phase shift is a value between 0 and 360 degrees where 360 degrees 
        represents a full pattern shift, 180 degrees means 1/2 pattern shift, 90 degrees 
        means 1/4 pattern shift, etc. 
        Note that this is NOT the actual spindle rotation. 
        The other mode you can set in the Preferences is "Fraction" mode where 1.0 means a 
        full pattern shift, 0.5 means 1/2 pattern shift, etc.
        The phase can be set by sliding the slider, by selecting the text in the value field 
        and typing in a new value, or by positioning the cursor in the value field and 
        rotating the scroll wheel on your mouse. 
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Mask:</b> Optional information for skipping some of the repeats. 
        When left blank, all repeats are used. 
        To mask certain repeat, enter a series of 0 and 1 digits. 
        A 0 (zero) means to skip the repeat. 
        A 1 (one) means to enable the repeat. 
        If the sequence of digits is shorter than the repeat value, then the sequence will 
        be used repeatedly. 
        For example -- entering 0111 with Repeat=12 will skip the 1st repeat, the 
        5th repeat, and the 9th repeat and use all other repeats. 
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>MaskHiLo:</b> Flag indicating if masking causes rosette to be the highest or the lowest in the pattern. 
      </li>

      <li>
        <b>MaskPhase:</b> Optional information for shifting the point in the pattern where 
        the masking will start. 
        As with Phase above, the number is either "Engineering" mode or "Fraction" mode 
        depending on how you have set your preferences. 
        In general, when you are cutting on the inside of a shape, you will probably want to 
        start the masking at a point in the pattern where the pattern is at "1.0" in the pattern 
        editor (which corresponds to a valley on the rosette). 
        Likewise, when you are cutting on the outside of a shape, you will probably want to 
        start the masking at a point in the pattern where the pattern is at "0.0" in the pattern 
        editor (which corresponds to a peak on the rosette). 
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>SymmetryAmplitude:</b> Optional information for changing the symmetry of a rosette by 
        varying the amplitude of the various repeats. 
        When left blank, there will be no variation in the amplitudes. 
        If the sequence of numbers is shorter than the repeat value, then the sequence will be used repeatedly. 
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>SymmetryWidth:</b> Optional information for changing the symmetry of a rosette by 
        varying the width of the various repeats. 
        When left blank, there will be no variation in the widths. 
        If the sequence of numbers is shorter than the repeat value, then the sequence will be used repeatedly. 
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Write Rosette Data</h3>
    <p>
      This allows you to write out the coordinates of the rosette to a tab-delimited file 
      that can be read by a spreadsheet program. 
      This is useful for those who wish to make their own rosettes. 
      You have the option of specifying the maximum radius of the rosette and specifying the 
      rotational spacing between points. 
      The file will list the radius at each rotation from 0 to 360 degrees. 
      Note that this option works for patterns that you design with the Pattern Editor as 
      well as for the built-in patterns.
