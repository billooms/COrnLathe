    <h2>RosetteBuilder</h2>
    <p>
      The RosetteBuilder window allows for editing and viewing a CompoundRosette which is 
      a combination of some number of rosettes. The RosetteBuilder is currently limited to 
      combining a maximum of 3 rosettes, although more than 3 can be combined if read directly from 
      the xml file. 
    </p>
    <p>
      The window is filled with three editing panes, one for each simple rosette that can 
      be used in the combination. For each simple rosette, you have the following parameters:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <b>Pattern:</b> See the help file on Patterns for more information on the various patterns. 
            Note that you can specify patterns that you design with the Pattern Editor as 
      		well as for the built-in patterns. 
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Repeat:</b> The number of times the pattern is repeated around the perimeter of the rosette.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Amplitude:</b> The peak-to-peak amplitude of the rosette. 
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Phase:</b> Phase shift for the cut. 
        Phase shift can be displayed in two different ways depending on how you have set 
        your preferences (see the Help topic on Preferences). 
        In "Engineering" mode, phase shift is a value between 0 and 360 degrees where 360 degrees 
        represents a full pattern shift, 180 degrees means 1/2 pattern shift, 90 degrees 
        means 1/4 pattern shift, etc. 
        Note that this is NOT the actual spindle rotation. 
        The other mode you can set in the Preferences is "Fraction" mode where 1.0 means a 
        full pattern shift, 0.5 means 1/2 pattern shift, etc.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Invert</b> -- Invert the pattern on the rosette. 
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Mask:</b> Optional information for skipping some of the repeats. 
        When left blank, all repeats are used. 
        To mask certain repeat, enter a series of 0 and 1 digits. 
        A 0 (zero) means to skip the repeat. 
        A 1 (one) means to enable the repeat. 
        If the sequence of digits is shorter than the repeat value, then the sequence will 
        be used repeatedly. 
        For example -- entering 0111 with Repeat=12 will skip the 1st repeat, the 
        5th repeat, and the 9th repeat and use all other repeats. 
      </li>

      <li>
        <b>MaskPhase:</b> Optional information for shifting the point in the pattern where 
        the masking will start. 
        As with Phase above, the number is either "Engineering" mode or "Fraction" mode 
        depending on how you have set your preferences. 
        In general, when you are cutting on the inside of a shape, you will probably want to 
        start the masking at a point in the pattern where the pattern is at "1.0" in the pattern 
        editor (which corresponds to a valley on the rosette). 
        Likewise, when you are cutting on the outside of a shape, you will probably want to 
        start the masking at a point in the pattern where the pattern is at "0.0" in the pattern 
        editor (which corresponds to a peak on the rosette). 
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>MaskHiLo:</b> Flag indicating if masking causes rosette to be the highest or the lowest in the pattern. 
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>N2:</b> Some patterns use the optional <b>N2</b> parameter which is the number of small bumps within a repeat. 
        For example -- an E rosette with 5 repeats and N2=6 will have a total of 30 bumps. 
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Amplitude2:</b> Some patterns use the optional <b>Amplitude2</b> parameter which is the amplitude of the small bumps as a 
        fraction if the total amplitude. 
        For example -- a Q rosette with a total amplitude of 0.3" and amplitude2=0.2" will have small bumps that are 
        0.06" (0.3 * 0.2 = 0.06) high superimposed on the major shape.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>SymmetryAmplitude:</b> Optional information for changing the symmetry of a rosette by 
        varying the amplitude of the various repeats. 
        When left blank, there will be no variation in the amplitudes. 
        If the sequence of numbers is shorter than the repeat value, then the sequence will be used repeatedly. 
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>SymmetryWidth:</b> Optional information for changing the symmetry of a rosette by 
        varying the width of the various repeats. 
        When left blank, there will be no variation in the widths. 
        If the sequence of numbers is shorter than the repeat value, then the sequence will be used repeatedly. 
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
    	In the lowest pane, you see a graphical representation of the combined result. 
    	The amplitude if the pattern in the graphical representation is not particularly important 
    	since the combined result will be scaled to the amplitude specified when used in a 
    	RosettePoint. 
    </p>
    <p>
    	On the left edge of the lowest pane, you see the possible ways of combining the rosettes. 
    	The first two rosettes are combined first with the first combine parameter, then that 
    	result is combined with the 3rd rosette base on the second combine parameter. 
    </p>
    <p>
    	The combine parameters refer to the deflection from the maximum radius of the rosette. 
    	Note that the deflection is always toward the center of the rosette (never outward from 
    	the center). Possible ways of combining are: 
    </p>
    <ul>
    	<li>
    		<b>NONE:</b> No combination -- the 1st rosette is used and the 2nd is ignored.
    	</li>
    	<li>
    		<b>MIN:</b> Use the minimum deflection of the two rosettes at every point in the 
    		rotation. 
    	</li>
    	<li>
    		<b>MAX:</b> Use the maximum deflection of the two rosettes at every point in the 
    		rotation. 
    	</li>
    	<li>
    		<b>ADD:</b> Add the deflection of the two rosettes at every point in the 
    		rotation. 
    	</li>
    	<li>
    		<b>SUB:</b> Subtract the deflection of the two rosettes at every point in the 
    		rotation. Note that this could result a som points of the rosette being outside 
    		the maximum radius of the rosette in the graphical representation. This will not cause 
    		any problem, because the actual deflection will be based on the amplitude specified 
    		when used in a RosettePoint. 
    	</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
    	To edit a CompoundRosette that is used in a RosettePoint, select the CompoundRosette's node
    	in the DataNavigator window. Then press the "Get Selected" button in the RosetteBuilder 
    	window. This will load the selected CompoundRosette for editing. Any edits you make in the 
    	Properties window will be reflected in the RosetteBuilder window, and edits in the 
    	RosetteBuilder window will be reflected in the Properties window.
    </p>
    <h3>Write Rosette Data</h3>
    <p>
      This allows you to write out the coordinates of the compound rosette to a tab-delimited file 
      that can be read by a spreadsheet program. 
      This is useful for those who wish to make their own rosettes. 
      You have the option of specifying the maximum radius of the rosette and specifying the 
      rotational spacing between points. 
      The file will list the radius at each rotation from 0 to 360 degrees. 
      Note that this option works for patterns that you design with the Pattern Editor as 
      well as for the built-in patterns.
