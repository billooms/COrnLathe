    <h2>DataNavigator</h2>
    <p>
      The DataNavigator window gives you the ability to manually edit nearly any parameter for 
      your project. 
      To use this window, you will also want to show the "Properties" window which shows all 
      the parameters of any object and lets you edit the values that can be changed. 
      As with any other window, the DataNavigator window and the Properties Window can be 
      re-sized and moved on the screen (or even detached from the main window to be "floating"). 
      You will find it easier to use if you have both of these windows near each other and 
      enlarged enough to see more content. 
    </p>
    <p>
      The data structures are hierarchical, just like folders and files on your computer. 
      When you see a small gray triangle pointing toward the right, there is more content. 
      Click on the arrow (or double click on the line of the object) to see more content. 
    </p>
    <p>
      You can also collapse the object to hide the information that you don't need to see. 
      When you see a small gray triangle pointing down, you can hide the details. 
      Click on the arrow (or double click on the line of the object) to hide the details. 
    </p>
    <p>
      When you click on any line, the Properties Window shows all the data associated with that object. 
      Some of the data might be informational only (and cannot be edited). 
      These values are grayed. 
      All editable data is in black. 
    </p>
    <p>
      When you click on a line in the DataNavigator, you may also have additional options 
      by right-clicking on the selected line (CTRL-click on a Mac if you don't have a 2-button mouse or 
      two-finger click with a trackpad). 
      The right-click options will vary depending on what kind of object has been selected.  
    </p>
    <p>
      You can edit multiple items at the same time by selecting more than one object. 
      When you enter a new value for some parameter shown in the Properties window, you will 
      change that value on all selected objects. 
    </p>
