        <h2>COrnLathe Preferences</h2>
        <p>
            The Preferences are found under the Preferences menu item (Mac users) 
            or under the "Tools --> Options" menu (PC and UNIX). 
            There are a number of capabilities that are available from the window 
            platform used by this software. 
            In particular, the "Keymap" tab allows you to assign/change the keyboard shortcut
            for any action.

        <p>
        	You can set your preference for how phase shift is presented and edited:
        </p>
        <p>
        	Engineering phase shift means that a phase shift of 360 means one full pattern phase shift. 
        	Likewise, 180 degrees means 1/2 pattern shift, and 90 degrees means 1/4 pattern shift. 
        	This is NOT the actual spindle rotation. 
        	The actual spindle rotation is this phase shift divided by the number of repeats. 
        	Those with an engineering background may feel more comfortable with this notation. 
        </p>
        <p>
        	Fractional phase shift means that a value of 1.0 means a full pattern phase shift. 
        	Likewise, 0.5 means 1/2 pattern shift, and 0.25 means 1/4 pattern shift. 
        	Many people will find this notation easier to understand.
        </p>
        <p>
        	Important: You will want to restart the program after changing the phase 
        	shift preference to make sure that all the user interface values are set properly. 
        	Also, note that the numerical values in the saved XML files will always be in 
        	engineering notation to allow compatibility with files saved by users with other settings.
