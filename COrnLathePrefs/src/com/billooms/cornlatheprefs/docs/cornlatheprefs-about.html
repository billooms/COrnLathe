        <h2>COrnLathe Preferences</h2>
        <p>
            The Preferences are found under the Preferences menu item (Mac users) 
            or under the "Tools --> Options" menu (PC and UNIX). 
            There are a number of capabilities that are available from the window 
            platform used by this software. 
            In particular, the "Keymap" tab allows you to assign/change the keyboard shortcut
            for any action.
        </p>
        <h3>Phase Shift Preferences</h3>
        <p>
        	You can set your preference for how phase shift is presented and edited:
        </p>
        <p>
        	Engineering phase shift means that a phase shift of 360 means one full pattern phase shift. 
        	Likewise, 180 degrees means 1/2 pattern shift, and 90 degrees means 1/4 pattern shift. 
        	This is NOT the actual spindle rotation. 
        	The actual spindle rotation is this phase shift divided by the number of repeats. 
        	Those with an engineering background may feel more comfortable with this notation. 
        </p>
        <p>
        	Fractional phase shift means that a value of 1.0 means a full pattern phase shift. 
        	Likewise, 0.5 means 1/2 pattern shift, and 0.25 means 1/4 pattern shift. 
        	Many people will find this notation easier to understand.
        </p>
        <p>
        	Important: You will want to restart the program after changing the phase 
        	shift preference to make sure that all the user interface values are set properly. 
        	Also, note that the numerical values in the saved XML files will always be in 
        	engineering notation to allow compatibility with files saved by users with other settings. 
        </p>
        <h3>Cutter Library</h3>
        <p>
        	You can specify an xml file to use as a cutter library. 
        	If you have a lot of cutting frames you will find this useful. 
        	Create an xml file and add as many cutters as you would like to have in your 
        	library (each with a unique name). 
        	Then open the COrnLathe Preferences and browse for that file. 
        	Your preferences will be saved after you exit the program and will be loaded again 
        	the next time you run the program.
        </p>
        <p>
        	When you are editing any other xml file, you can load from the library by 
        	right clicking on the "Cutters" node in the Data Navigator and choose 
        	"Add Cutter from Library". A pop-up dialog will appear which will let you select 
        	the cutter you wish to add. Once added, you can make further edits on the newly 
        	added cutter. 
        </p>
