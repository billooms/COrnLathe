    <h2>PatternEditor</h2>
    <p>
      The Pattern Editor allows you to quickly create your own rosette patterns. 
      The plot shows a normalized version of a single repeat of the pattern. 
      The horizontal scale goes from zero to one, and the vertical scale goes from 
      zero to one. 
    </p>
    <p>
      A point at the bottom represents zero deflection from the maximum radius of the rosette. 
      A point at the top represents a maximum deflection of the rosette as determined by the 
      rosette's peak-to-peak amplitude. 
      You will find it helpful to look at the rosette with the Rosette Viewer as you are 
      constructing a pattern.  
      As changes are made, you will see a small icon below the pattern selection box. 
    </p>
    <p>
      Important -- for the software to work properly, the plot must completely fill the 
      total height and total width of the outlined box. 
      In general, you will want the left side and right side to be the same height or 
      you will have a sharp step in the rosette where one pattern repeat meets the 
      adjacent pattern repeat.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <b>New Pattern</b> -- This creates a new pattern with the name that you provide. 
        You have the option of creating several different kinds of lines/curves as indicated below.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Adding Points</b> -- Double click on the display window to add a point. 
        To move a point, click near it and drag it to a new location. 
        To delete a point, drag it off the display area. 
        Points are in sorted order from left to right. 
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Manually editing points</b> -- you can manually edit the precise positions of the 
        coordinates by using the DataNavigator Window together with the Properties Window. 
        Click on "Patterns:" and expand the listing to see all the points. 
        When you select a point, you will be able to manually edit the coordinates in the 
        "Properties" window. 
        See the Help file on the DataNavigator Window for more information.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Normalize</b> -- This re-adjusts the curve you entered so that the curve 
        completely fills the area. 
        You should always use the Normalize function at the end of all edits. 
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Invert</b> -- Flip the curve top to bottom.  
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Delete</b> -- Delete this pattern.  
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Mirror L->R</b> -- Mirror the curve left to right. 
        Points to the right of center are deleted, and all points to the left of 
        center are mirrored and added to the right side.  
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Clear</b> -- Clear all points and start over again. 
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      The built-in patterns cannot be edited or deleted.
    </p>
    <p>
      You can also write a short program for your own custom patterns and have them 
      permanently added to your copy of the software. 
      This enables you do write a pattern module and share it with 
      other users of this software. 
    </p>
    <h3>Various styles of lines/curves</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <b>Straight Lines</b> -- a straight line is drawn between each point.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Curve Fit</b> -- all points are fit to a single curve. 
        This works best when you have more points close together. 
        If you have only a few points that are widely separated, you may get 
        a bizarre result.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Arc Segments</b> -- each group of 3 points is a curve-fit arc. 
        Each segment shares a point with the previous segment to form a continuous line. 
        For example, the 1st, 2nd, 3rd points form an arc segment, the 3rd point is shared with the 
        next segment, the 3rd, 4th, 5th points are the next arc segment, etc. 
        If there are an even number of points, the last arc segment is a straight line.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Sine/Cosine Segments</b> -- Similar to the Arc Segments style above, but 
        the segments are fit to a quarter of a sine/cosine curve. 
        The even numbered points define whether the curve segment is concave or convex. 
        Note that the even numbered points do not necessarily end up on the curve -- they 
        only indicate the direction of curvature.
      </li>
    </ul>
